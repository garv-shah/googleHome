# googleHome
This is a little project I'm working on over the holidays, upon the discovery of an old camcorder in our house as well as a google home. 
The intention is to hook up the camcorder to my laptop such that when it detects my face, the google home yells my name.

Update:
I've gotten the Google Home to work almost flawlessly with a web server on my laptop. This could lead to some pretty cool applications such a TTS Email Client for my Mum

To Do:
- [ ] Get my hands on a capture card for the camcorder
